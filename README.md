# Option_Prices_OOP

This Python project provides an updated (from my previous Option_prices project) object-oriented approach for calculating option prices and Greeks for both Call and Put options. 
The project is designed to be easily extendable and reusable, following practices such as inheritance and the use of abstract methods.
It supports European-style options and leverages the Black-Scholes model for pricing.
